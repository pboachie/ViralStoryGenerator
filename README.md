# Viral Story Generator üöÄ‚ú®

Welcome to **Viral Story Generator** ‚Äì your one-stop tool for creating engaging, short story scripts powered by a local LLM endpoint. This project not only generates compelling story scripts but also produces audio using ElevenLabs and constructs detailed storyboards for video production. üéâ

---

## Features
- **Story Script Generation:** Automatically generates creative story scripts with video descriptions.
- **Audio TTS:** Converts the narrative into high-quality MP3 audio using ElevenLabs TTS. üîä
- **Storyboard Creation:** Produces JSON-formatted storyboards for video planning and production.
- **Source Cleansing:** Merges and summarizes multiple source files into a coherent narrative.
- **Web Scraping:** Utilizes crawl4ai to extract content from web sources.

---

## Installation
Install the package using Python's setuptools:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
- `requests`
- `python-dotenv`
- `crawl4ai`

You can install these via pip if needed:
```bash
pip install .
```

---

## Configuration
Copy the sample environment file to a new file named `.env` and update the values as needed:
- `LOG_LEVEL` (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, etc.)
- `LLM_ENDPOINT` ‚Äì Local LLM API endpoint.
- `LLM_MODEL` ‚Äì Model name for story generation.
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` ‚Äì Your ElevenLabs API key.
- `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` ‚Äì ElevenLabs voice ID.
- And more options in the provided [.env.sample](.env.sample). üîß

## Setting Up Your Environment
1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. **Copy the .env Example:**
   Copy the sample file to create your environment configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```
4. **Edit the .env File:**
   Open `.env` in your favorite text editor and adjust the configuration values to match your setup.

## Usage
The Viral Story Generator is now available as an HTTP service. You can interact with it using the REST API endpoints.

### API Endpoints
Access the service through the following endpoints:

- **Generate a story:** Send a POST request to the story generation endpoint with your topic
- **Check status:** Monitor the progress of your story generation task
- **Retrieve results:** Get your completed story, audio, and storyboard

For detailed API documentation, refer to the API documentation when the server is running.

## Docker Setup üê≥

### Development Setup
To run the application in a development environment using Docker:

1. **Build and start the containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Check the status of the containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

3. **View logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

4. **Stop the containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Production Setup
For production deployment with scaling and monitoring:

1. **Copy and customize environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

2. **Deploy with production configuration:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Scale services as needed:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --scale scraper=5 --scale backend=3
   ```

4. **Access monitoring dashboards:**
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (default credentials: admin/admin)
   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

### Container Architecture
This project uses a containerized architecture with separate services:

- **Redis**: Queue management and shared state
- **Backend**: Main application for story generation
- **Scraper**: Worker processes for crawl4ai web scraping
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for observability (production only)

Each service is independently scalable to handle increased load.
