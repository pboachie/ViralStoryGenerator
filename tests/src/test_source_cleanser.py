# Test scenario 1: Verify RAG active log message upon module import

# To test the log message at module import time, we need to patch the logger
# *before* the module is imported for the first time by the test runner or this test file.
# A common way to handle this is to ensure the patch is active when the module is
# first loaded by Python's import system during test collection or execution.

# If source_cleanser.py is imported elsewhere and already in sys.modules,
# the top-level code might have already run.
# For a clean test of import-time logging, it's best if this test is the first
# to cause its import, or we can try to reload the module (which can be tricky).

# Let's assume pytest will run this test in a way that the patch can be effective
# before or during the first import of source_cleanser by this test file.

def test_source_cleanser_module_logs_rag_active_on_import(mock_logger_source_cleanser):
    # The act of importing the module will execute its top-level code.
    # If the test file itself imports source_cleanser at the top, the patch
    # needs to be active *before* that top-level import.
    # Pytest's patching mechanism with `@patch` should handle this correctly if
    # this is the first import in the test session for this module, or if the
    # patching mechanism is smart enough to re-evaluate/re-patch.
    
    # To be absolutely sure, we can import the module *inside* the test function
    # when the patch is definitely active.
    import viralStoryGenerator.src.source_cleanser as source_cleanser_module
    
    # Reloading can also be an option if the module might have been imported by other tests:
    # import importlib
    # importlib.reload(source_cleanser_module) # This would re-trigger top-level code
    # However, reloading has its own complexities and side effects.
    # For this case, importing within the test function under patch should be sufficient.
