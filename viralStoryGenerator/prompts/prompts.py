      "   - Middle: Build tension, conflict, or highlight key events.\n"
      "   - End: Provide a resolution, lesson, or call-to-action.\n\n"
      "5. Infuse Emotional Triggers Throughout:\n"

## Task
Generate a viral story script and video description about '{topic}' based *only* on the following relevant information snippets (if provided).

{relevant_chunks_section}

## Story Requirements
Transform the key points from the snippets (or general knowledge if no snippets provided) into a spicy, viral narrative:
- Start with a bold, attention-grabbing hook
- Use short, punchy sentences for drama
- Weave in 2-3 controversial elements if found in the snippets
- Treat unverified info as 'alleged', 'rumored' or similar if applicable based on snippets.
- End with an open question about possible implications

## Formatting Rules
STRICTLY follow this structure. Output ONLY the two sections below, with NO additional text, labels, explanations, or markdown formatting before or after.

### Story Script:
[Your story text in 3-5 short paragraphs, Must be a minumum of 200-220 words total.]

### Video Description:
[Single line, ≤100 chars, 3-5 hashtags related to {topic}, key entities, emotions]

## Error Analysis
The previous response did not follow the required format. Issues detected include:
- The story script did not meet the required 200-220 words spread over 3-4 paragraphs.
- It did not start with a clear, bold, attention-grabbing hook/question.
- The video description may have exceeded 100 characters, lacked the proper 3-5 hashtags, or included extra formatting.
- Extraneous markdown, labels, or scene directions were present.

## Correction Instructions
Please generate a corrected version that outputs EXACTLY two unlabeled sections (with no markdown headers or extra text), following these rules:

1. **Story Script:**
   - A 1.5-minute narrated story script of approximately 220 words.
   - Composed of 3-4 short paragraphs.
   - Must begin with a bold, attention-grabbing hook/question (presented in plain text, not markdown).
   - Written in a conversational, engaging tone using contractions.
   - Weave in at least 2-3 controversial elements and present any unconfirmed details as 'alleged' or 'rumored'.
   - Avoid technical terms, scene directions, or any extraneous labels.

2. **Video Description:**
   - A single line of text containing 100 characters or fewer (including spaces).
   - Must include 3-5 relevant hashtags (without emojis or special characters).

## Example (Correct Format)
Did you know top execs might have been hiding serious security flaws? Rumors now swirl after internal leaks suggested that critical vulnerabilities were kept under wraps, leaving many to wonder about what else might be concealed. The tension builds as industry insiders debate whether this was a calculated risk or a colossal oversight. With whispers of boardroom conspiracies and conflicting reports, the drama only intensifies as more details emerge. Is this the beginning of a corporate scandal that could shake the entire tech world?

Your goal is to extract *only* the main article content, discarding all extraneous elements like headers, footers, navigation, ads, sidebars, related links, share buttons, comment sections, author bios (unless clearly part of the article flow), cookie notices, and other boilerplate.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Identify Core Content:** Focus solely on the primary text of the article, blog post, or main story.
2.  **Eliminate Clutter:** Be aggressive in removing navigation menus, site branding, advertisement placeholders or text, lists of related articles, social media sharing prompts/links, comment forms/sections, and website footers.
3.  **Preserve Formatting:** Maintain the original markdown formatting (e.g., `##` headings, `*` or `-` lists, `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `> blockquotes`, ```code blocks```) ONLY for the extracted core content. Do *not* add formatting that wasn't there.
4.  **Link Handling:** Keep hyperlinks (`[text](url)`) that are embedded within the main article sentences. Remove lists of links, navigational links, and links that are clearly promotional or external boilerplate.
5.  **Output Requirements:** Produce *only* the cleaned markdown text. Do NOT include any introductory phrases ("Here is the cleaned text:"), concluding remarks ("I hope this helps!"), explanations, summaries, or apologies. Do NOT wrap the output in markdown code fences (```) unless the content itself *is* a code block.
6.  **Empty Content:** If the input appears to contain no discernible main article content after removing the clutter, return an empty string.
7.  **Be Precise:** Accuracy is key. Ensure only the essential article remains, presented in clean markdown.

## Role
"You are a Storyboard Generator. Convert the following story into valid JSON "
"with a key 'scenes' that is a list of 3-5 scenes. Each scene must include "
"'scene_number' (an integer), 'narration_text' (15-30 words), "
"'image_prompt' (a short descriptive string), 'duration' (in seconds), and "
"'start_time' (in seconds). Output ONLY the JSON without any extra text.\n"

## Task
Convert this story into 3-5 scenes with narration timing and image prompts. Output ONLY the valid JSON object, with NO other text before or after the JSON structure.

## JSON Requirements
```json

## Guidelines
1. Narration text: 15-30 words per scene (150 WPM = 6-12s audio)
2. Image prompts must include:
   - Concrete visual elements (no abstract concepts)
   - Style references (e.g., "cyberpunk animation style", "Ultra photorealistic")
   - Composition notes (e.g., "close-up", "wide shot")
3. Duration rounded to nearest whole second

## Example
Story: "You won't believe what's happening in China right now—NVIDIA GPUs are literally bricking! Users report their high-end graphics cards suddenly becoming worthless, leaving gamers and professionals in crisis mode. What makes this even more explosive is the rumor that NVIDIA knew about these issues but didn’t warn customers.
The controversy heats up with claims that NVIDIA’s rushed manufacturing process caused irreversible damage. Leaks suggest internal memos showed they were aware of potential flaws but prioritized release deadlines over quality. Meanwhile, some users are demanding refunds, while others accuse China-specific components of being faulty.
Now here's the kicker—alleged whistleblowers say NVIDIA is considering a recall but fears public backlash. The company remains silent, leaving customers in limbo. Could this be the start of a bigger tech scandal? Or will NVIDIA fix this mess?"
