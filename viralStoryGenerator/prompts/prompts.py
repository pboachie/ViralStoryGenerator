      "# 7. Follow a Step-by-Step Framework to Craft a Viral Story\n\n"
      "1. Identify a Compelling Core Message or Emotion:\n"
      "   - Extract the essence from the source material (news, personal anecdote, or fiction).\n"
      "   - Determine the emotional hook that will make the audience care.\n\n"
      "2. Know Your Audience & Platform:\n"
      "   - Tailor tone, language, and format to suit the target audience and platform (e.g., short and snappy for TikTok, professional for LinkedIn).\n\n"
      "3. Craft an Immediate Hook:\n"
      "   - Use an intriguing question, bold statement, or striking visual in the first 2–3 seconds/lines.\n\n"
      "4. Develop a Clear Narrative Arc:\n"
      "   - Beginning: Introduce context and characters.\n"
      "   - Middle: Build tension, conflict, or highlight key events.\n"
      "   - End: Provide a resolution, lesson, or call-to-action.\n\n"
      "5. Infuse Emotional Triggers Throughout:\n"
      "   - Strategically add elements that evoke surprise, curiosity, laughter, or empathy.\n\n"
      "6. Enhance with Media:\n"
      "   - Complement the narrative with visuals, video, audio, or infographics that support the story’s emotional impact.\n\n"
      "7. Encourage Interaction:\n"
      "   - Insert calls-to-action that invite audience participation (comments, tags, sharing personal experiences).\n\n"
      "8. Optimize for Discovery:\n"
      "   - Use appropriate hashtags, keywords, and post timing to maximize reach and engagement.\n\n"
      "9. Edit and Refine:\n"
      "   - Remove unnecessary fluff and ensure the story is clear, concise, and error-free.\n\n"
      "10. Engage Post-Launch:\n"
      "   - Actively monitor and respond to comments, and consider cross-posting or boosting content as needed.\n\n"
      "# Final Takeaway\n\n"
      "- Authenticity and Emotional Resonance: Always ensure the story is genuine and emotionally engaging to convert one-time viewers into long-term followers.\n"
      "- Platform Adaptation: Adjust the storytelling format based on where it’s being published.\n"
      "- Iterative Improvement: Use feedback and engagement data to refine future content.\n\n"

## Error Analysis
The previous response did not follow the required format. Issues detected include:
- The story script did not meet the required 200-220 words spread over 3-4 paragraphs.
- It did not start with a clear, bold, attention-grabbing hook/question.
- The video description may have exceeded 100 characters, lacked the proper 3-5 hashtags, or included extra formatting.
- Extraneous markdown, labels, or scene directions were present.

## Correction Instructions
Please generate a corrected version that outputs EXACTLY two unlabeled sections (with no markdown headers or extra text), following these rules:

1. **Story Script:**
   - A 1.5-minute narrated story script of approximately 220 words.
   - Composed of 3-4 short paragraphs.
   - Must begin with a bold, attention-grabbing hook/question (presented in plain text, not markdown).
   - Written in a conversational, engaging tone using contractions.
   - Weave in at least 2-3 controversial elements and present any unconfirmed details as 'alleged' or 'rumored'.
   - Avoid technical terms, scene directions, or any extraneous labels.

2. **Video Description:**
   - A single line of text containing 100 characters or fewer (including spaces).
   - Must include 3-5 relevant hashtags (without emojis or special characters).

## Example (Correct Format)

    Creates a prompt for the LLM to clean raw markdown content.

        A formatted user prompt string.
    """
    return f"""Analyze the following raw markdown text scraped from a webpage. Your goal is to extract *only* the main article content, discarding all extraneous elements.

**CRUCIAL OVERARCHING PRINCIPLE: VERBATIM EXTRACTION, NOT GENERATION.**
**YOUR TASK IS TO *EXTRACT* EXISTING CONTENT. DO *NOT* SUMMARIZE, PARAPHRASE, REWRITE, INTERPRET, OR GENERATE NEW TEXT. THE OUTPUT MUST BE A VERBATIM SUBSET OF THE INPUT, CONTAINING ONLY THE IDENTIFIED ARTICLE CONTENT. ANY DEVIATION FROM THIS IS A FAILURE.**

**Key Principles:**
1.  **Article Centricity:** The primary goal is to isolate the narrative/informational core of the article.
2.  **Aggressive Clutter Removal:** Remove anything not contributing directly to the article's main content.
3.  **Format Fidelity:** Preserve original markdown formatting *only* for the extracted article content.

**Detailed Instructions:**

1.  **Identify Article Boundaries:**
    *   **Start:** Locate the main article headline (often a H1, H2, or prominent large text). The core article content typically begins with or immediately after this headline and any directly associated byline/date.
    *   **End:** The article content usually ends before sections like "Related Articles," "Up Next," "Most Read," "Comments," "Author Bio (if a separate, distinct block)," "Tags," or the website footer.

2.  **Core Content Extraction:**
    *   Preserve the main textual body, including paragraphs, blockquotes, and lists (`*`, `-`, `1.`) that form the article's narrative.
    *   Keep images (`![alt](src)`) and their accompanying captions if they are embedded within and illustrative of the article content.
    *   Retain headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) that structure the main article itself.
    *   Keep hyperlinks (`[text](url)`) that are part of sentences within the core content.

3.  **Header & Preamble Handling:**
    *   Discard global site headers, primary navigation menus (top, side, or hamburger menus), site branding/logos (unless it's an image clearly part of the article's masthead area and not a general site logo), search bars, and login/account links typically found at the very top of a page or in persistent sidebars.
    *   Keep the article's main headline.
    *   Keep bylines (e.g., "By Author Name"), publication dates, update dates, and brief source attributions (e.g., "City, ST — Source:") if they directly precede or immediately follow the main headline and serve to introduce the article.

4.  **Clutter Elimination (Non-Exhaustive List):**
    *   **Navigation:** All forms of site navigation (menus, breadcrumbs, lists of sections/categories, "More" links leading to other site sections, pagination links not essential for reading a single article).
    *   **Promotional Content:** Advertisements, ad placeholders (e.g., text like "Advertisement", "Ad Feedback"), "paid content" sections, "sponsored by" notices, lists of affiliate links.
    *   **Social Interaction:** Social media sharing buttons/links (including those with only icons and no descriptive text, e.g., `[ ](social_url)`), "Share this" prompts, like/reaction buttons, "Link Copied!" messages, comment submission forms, and displayed comment sections.
    *   **Related Content:** Lists, carousels, or grids of "Related Articles," "Recommended Reading," "Up Next," "More from [Site]," "Most Popular/Read."
    *   **Author Information (Standalone):** Author biographies presented as separate, standalone blocks (e.g., an "About the Author" box at the end of the article), especially if they are lengthy or contain promotional links. A simple byline (as per instruction 3) should be kept.
    *   **Website Footer Content:** Copyright notices, privacy policy links, terms of service, "About Us" links, contact links, site maps, and other boilerplate links typically found at the bottom of every page.
    *   **Cookie/Privacy Banners:** Cookie consent banners, privacy notices, GDPR pop-ups.
    *   **UI/UX Elements:** Non-content UI elements such as "scroll to top" buttons, print buttons (unless the content is about printing), font size adjusters, theme toggles, or purely functional links/buttons not part of the article's text. "Ad Feedback" forms or links.
    *   **Redundant Elements:** Repeated navigation blocks, account management sections that might appear in multiple places.
    *   **Empty/Icon Links:** Remove links that primarily serve as icons or have no descriptive link text (e.g., `[ ](url)`), especially if they are adjacent to bylines or in social sharing areas, and are not part of the main article's narrative flow. (Exception: image links `![alt](src)` as per instruction 2).

5.  **Formatting & Links (Reiteration):**
    *   Maintain original markdown formatting (`**bold**`, `*italic*`, lists, ` ```code blocks``` `, etc.) exclusively for the extracted article. Do not introduce new formatting or alter existing formatting of the core content.
    *   Remove navigational, promotional, or boilerplate link lists. Only hyperlinks embedded naturally within the article's sentences and paragraphs should remain.

6.  **Special Sections Within Article Flow:**
    *   Retain sections like "Methodology," "Sources," "Acknowledgements," or "Editor's Note" if they are clearly part of the article's structure (e.g., follow the main body, use article headings) and provide essential context, support, or clarification for its content, rather than being generic site-wide links or separate pages.

7.  **Output Requirements:**
    *   **YOUR RESPONSE MUST CONSIST *SOLELY* AND *EXCLUSIVELY* OF THE CLEANED MARKDOWN TEXT OF THE MAIN ARTICLE. THERE SHOULD BE NO OTHER TEXT WHATSOEVER IN YOUR RESPONSE.**
    *   **ABSOLUTELY NO** introductory phrases (e.g., "Here is the cleaned text:"), NO concluding remarks (e.g., "I hope this helps!"), NO explanations, NO summaries, NO apologies, NO comments about your process, NO disclaimers, NO labels, NO preambles.
    *   Do NOT wrap the *entire* output in markdown code fences (```) unless the *entire extracted article itself* is a single markdown code block (which is rare). If the article contains code blocks, those should be preserved *within* the extracted article text, not wrapping the whole thing.
    *   **IF YOU ARE TEMPTED TO ADD *ANY* TEXT THAT IS NOT DIRECTLY AND VERBATIM EXTRACTED FROM THE ARTICLE PORTION OF THE INPUT, SUPPRESS THAT TEMPTATION. OUTPUT *ONLY* THE ARTICLE ITSELF.**

8.  **Handling No Content:** If, after aggressive cleaning, no discernible main article content remains (e.g., the page was purely navigational or an error page), output an empty string. **AND NOTHING ELSE. NOT EVEN A SPACE.**

9.  **Precision and Focus:** Prioritize accuracy. The aim is a clean, uninterrupted representation of the article's primary content, as if it were the only thing on the page. Be discerning about what constitutes the "main story."

def get_storyboard_prompt(story):
    return f"""
## Role
You are a Storyboard Planner. Analyze the provided story and identify logical scene breaks. For each scene, provide a starting marker (the first few words) and an image prompt.

## Task
Analyze the input story's narrative flow and emotional tone. Identify 3-5 logical scene breaks. For each scene, provide:
1.  `scene_number`: An integer starting from 1.
2.  `scene_start_marker`: The **exact first 5 to 10 words** of the text segment that should begin this scene. This marker **MUST** be a non-empty string copied precisely from the beginning of the corresponding text segment in the input story. It is critical for splitting the story later.
3.  `image_prompt`: A concise DALL-E image description for the scene.
Output ONLY the valid JSON object containing a 'scenes' list, with NO other text before or after the JSON structure. Adhere strictly to the schema.

## JSON Requirements
{{
  "scenes": [
    {{
      "scene_number": 1,
      "scene_start_marker": "Exact first 5-10 words of the scene...", // CRITICAL: Must be exact, non-empty text from the story.
      "image_prompt": "DALL-E description focusing on: [1] Main subject [2] Style refs [3] Key details",
      "duration": 0, // Placeholder - Will be calculated later
      "start_time": 0 // Placeholder - Will be calculated later
    }}
    // ... more scenes ...
  ]
}}

## Guidelines
1.  **Analyze Flow & Tone:** Read the entire story to understand its structure, pacing, and emotional shifts.
2.  **Identify Breaks:** Determine 3-5 points where the narrative logically shifts (change in time, location, focus, or emotion).
3.  **Extract Start Markers:** For each identified scene break, copy the **exact first 5 to 10 words** from the original story that mark the beginning of that scene. These markers **MUST** be accurate, non-empty string substrings of the original story. Double-check this requirement.
4.  **Image Prompts:** Generate a concise, descriptive `image_prompt` for each scene, including:
    *   Concrete visual elements (no abstract concepts).
    *   Style references (e.g., "cyberpunk animation style", "Ultra photorealistic").
    *   Composition notes (e.g., "close-up", "wide shot").
5.  **Placeholders:** Set `duration` and `start_time` to `0`.
6.  **Output:** Generate ONLY the valid JSON structure. No extra text, explanations, or markdown. Ensure all required fields, especially `scene_start_marker`, are present and correctly formatted for every scene.
