## Source Material Analysis
Analyze these {topic} sources and identify:
1. Core controversy or unique angle
2. Key technical issues or failures (explain simply, avoid jargon)
3. Unconfirmed or speculative claims from leaks (treat as rumors)
4. Industry or public reactions if available

## Story Requirements
Transform these key points into a spicy, viral narrative:
- Start with a bold, attention-grabbing hook
- Use short, punchy sentences for drama
- Weave in 2-3 controversial elements from the sources
- Treat unverified info as 'alleged' or 'rumored'
- End with an open question about possible implications

## Formatting Rules
STRICTLY follow this structure:

### Story Script:
[Your story text in 3-5 short paragraphs, Must be a minumum of 200-220 words total. No markdown]

### Video Description:
[Single line, ‚â§100 chars, 3-5 hashtags related to {topic}, key entities, emotions]

## Example Output
Sources: "Internal memo suggests CEO knew about security flaws... Reddit leaks show prototype images..."

### Story Script:
You won't believe what leaked from TechCorp's secret servers. Internal docs reveal...

### Video Description:
CEO knew about security flaws? #TechScandal #DataLeak #CorporateDrama

## Error Analysis
The previous response did not follow the required format. Issues detected include:
- The story script did not meet the required 200-220 words spread over 3-4 paragraphs.
- It did not start with a clear, bold, attention-grabbing hook/question.
- The video description may have exceeded 100 characters, lacked the proper 3-5 hashtags, or included extra formatting.
- Extraneous markdown, labels, or scene directions were present.

## Correction Instructions
Please generate a corrected version that outputs EXACTLY two unlabeled sections (with no markdown headers or extra text), following these rules:

1. **Story Script:**
   - A 1.5-minute narrated story script of approximately 220 words.
   - Composed of 3-4 short paragraphs.
   - Must begin with a bold, attention-grabbing hook/question (presented in plain text, not markdown).
   - Written in a conversational, engaging tone using contractions.
   - Weave in at least 2-3 controversial elements and present any unconfirmed details as 'alleged' or 'rumored'.
   - Avoid technical terms, scene directions, or any extraneous labels.

2. **Video Description:**
   - A single line of text containing 100 characters or fewer (including spaces).
   - Must include 3-5 relevant hashtags (without emojis or special characters).

## Example (Correct Format)
Did you know top execs might have been hiding serious security flaws? Rumors now swirl after internal leaks suggested that critical vulnerabilities were kept under wraps, leaving many to wonder about what else might be concealed. The tension builds as industry insiders debate whether this was a calculated risk or a colossal oversight. With whispers of boardroom conspiracies and conflicting reports, the drama only intensifies as more details emerge. Is this the beginning of a corporate scandal that could shake the entire tech world?

## Role
You are a Storyboard Generator that converts stories into structured JSON for video production.

## Task
Convert this story into 3-5 scenes with narration timing and image prompts.

## JSON Requirements
{{
  "scenes": [
    {{
      "scene_number": 1,
      "narration_text": "Exact text to narrate",
      "image_prompt": "DALL-E description focusing on: [1] Main subject [2] Style refs [3] Key details",
      "duration": 5
    }}
  ]
}}

## Guidelines
1. Narration text: 15-30 words per scene (150 WPM = 6-12s audio)
2. Image prompts must include:
   - Concrete visual elements (no abstract concepts)
   - Style references (e.g., "cyberpunk animation style")
   - Composition notes (e.g., "close-up", "wide shot")
3. Duration rounded to nearest whole second

## Example
Story: "The leaked documents showed prototype designs that..."
{{
  "scenes": [
    {{
      "scene_number": 1,
      "narration_text": "Hidden in plain sight - these leaked blueprints reveal...",
