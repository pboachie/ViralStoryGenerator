## Source Material Analysis
Analyze these {topic} sources and identify:
1. Core controversy or unique angle
2. Key technical issues or failures (explain simply, avoid jargon)
3. Unconfirmed or speculative claims from leaks (treat as rumors)
4. Industry or public reactions if available

## Story Requirements
Transform these key points into a spicy, viral narrative:
- Start with a bold, attention-grabbing hook
- Use short, punchy sentences for drama
- Weave in 2-3 controversial elements from the sources
- Treat unverified info as 'alleged', 'rumored' or similar and avoid definitive statements. Warn about potential inaccuracies if needed.
- End with an open question about possible implications

## Formatting Rules
STRICTLY follow this structure:

### Story Script:
[Your story text in 3-5 short paragraphs, Must be a minumum of 200-220 words total. No markdown]

### Video Description:
[Single line, ‚â§100 chars, 3-5 hashtags related to {topic}, key entities, emotions]

## Example Output
Sources: "Internal memo suggests CEO knew about security flaws... Reddit leaks show prototype images..."

### Story Script:
You won't believe what leaked from TechCorp's secret servers. Internal docs reveal...

### Video Description:
CEO knew about security flaws? #TechScandal #DataLeak #CorporateDrama

## Error Analysis
The previous response did not follow the required format. Issues detected include:
- The story script did not meet the required 200-220 words spread over 3-4 paragraphs.
- It did not start with a clear, bold, attention-grabbing hook/question.
- The video description may have exceeded 100 characters, lacked the proper 3-5 hashtags, or included extra formatting.
- Extraneous markdown, labels, or scene directions were present.

## Correction Instructions
Please generate a corrected version that outputs EXACTLY two unlabeled sections (with no markdown headers or extra text), following these rules:

1. **Story Script:**
   - A 1.5-minute narrated story script of approximately 220 words.
   - Composed of 3-4 short paragraphs.
   - Must begin with a bold, attention-grabbing hook/question (presented in plain text, not markdown).
   - Written in a conversational, engaging tone using contractions.
   - Weave in at least 2-3 controversial elements and present any unconfirmed details as 'alleged' or 'rumored'.

2. **Video Description:**
   - A single line of text containing 100 characters or fewer (including spaces).
   - Must include 3-5 relevant hashtags (without emojis or special characters).

## Example (Correct Format)

Rumors now swirl after internal leaks suggested that critical vulnerabilities were kept under wraps, leaving many to wonder about what else might be concealed. The tension builds as industry insiders debate whether this was a calculated risk or a colossal oversight. With whispers of boardroom conspiracies and conflicting reports, the drama only intensifies as more details emerge. Is this the beginning of a corporate scandal that could shake the entire tech world?

## Example
Story: "You won't believe what's happening in China right now‚ÄîNVIDIA GPUs are literally bricking! Users report their high-end graphics cards suddenly becoming worthless, leaving gamers and professionals in crisis mode. What makes this even more explosive is the rumor that NVIDIA knew about these issues but didn‚Äôt warn customers.
The controversy heats up with claims that NVIDIA‚Äôs rushed manufacturing process caused irreversible damage.

Meanwhile, some users are demanding refunds, while others accuse China-specific components of being faulty.
Now here's the kicker‚Äîalleged whistleblowers say NVIDIA is considering a recall but fears public backlash. The company remains silent, leaving customers in limbo. Could this be the start of a bigger tech scandal? Or will NVIDIA fix this mess?"
